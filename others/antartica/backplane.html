        <p>You grab your stuff and make it to the back of the plane. You hope for the best.</p>
        <p>The plane crashes and you fall unconscious for a while. When you wake up all you feel is cold around you and an eerie silence.</p>

        <p>Then you realize, you are fully surrounded by snow. Nobody else survived.</p>
        <p>You start to get yourself out of the snow, but you only manage to get half of your body out.</p>
        <p>And there it ends.... your adventure comes to an end.</p>
